    "#### 1. Linearity:\n",
    "- Assumption: Linear regression assumes that the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is linear.\n",
    "- Checking: You can visually inspect scatter plots of the independent variables against the dependent variable to see if they exhibit a roughly linear pattern. Additionally, you can use residual plots to check for linearity by plotting the residuals (observed values minus predicted values) against the independent variables. A random scatter in the residual plot indicates linearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.Independence of Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assumption: The errors (residuals) should be independent of each other. This means that the value of the error for one observation should not depend on the values of the errors for other observations.\n",
    "- Checking: You can examine a plot of residuals against the order of data collection (time or index) to check for any patterns or autocorrelation. A lack of patterns suggests independence\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assumption: The variance of the residuals should be constant across all levels of the independent variables. In other words, the spread of the residuals should remain consistent.\n",
    "- Checking: You can create a scatter plot of residuals against predicted values. If the spread of residuals appears to be roughly constant across the range of predicted values, the assumption is met. Alternatively, you can perform statistical tests like the Breusch-Pagan test or the White test to check for heteroscedasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.Normality of Residuals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assumption: The residuals should be normally distributed. This assumption is important for making valid statistical inferences and constructing confidence intervals.\n",
    "- Checking: You can create a histogram or a Q-Q plot of the residuals to assess their normality. If the residuals approximately follow a bell-shaped curve and the points on the Q-Q plot fall along a straight line, the assumption is more likely to hold. You can also use statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test or the Anderson-Darling test for formal normality assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### No Multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assumption (for multiple linear regression): The independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other (multicollinearity), as this can lead to unstable coefficient estimates.\n",
    "- Checking: Calculate the correlation matrix for the independent variables. If there are high correlations (close to 1 or -1) between pairs of independent variables, it may indicate multicollinearity. You can also compute Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) for each variable, and a high VIF (typically above 5 or 10) suggests multicollinearity."
